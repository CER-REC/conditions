# Feature Type Description

This section contains a list of categories for the selected feature, explaining what sorts of conditions each might refer to. The text is scrollable.

## Interaction Requirements

- Users should be able to scroll through the list.
- When the user selects a feature type in the Small Multiples Legend, the list should scroll to the description for that type. (Parent component should pass `scrollTarget="security"` as a prop to trigger this)

## Accessibility Requirements

- [ ] Arrow keys to scroll up and down

## Analytics Requirements

- [ ] Tabbing to the wrapper should emit an event

## Unit Testing

TODO: Provide table of automated unit test results and code coverage metrics.

## Examples

TODO: Implement examples of different implementations with sandbox for editing
properties on the fly.
