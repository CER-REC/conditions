# Project Legend

The legend is a guide for reading the rest of the visualization. It is important
that the squares in the legend be in alignment with the corresponding bars in the bar charts. 
Note that there is an opacity change in the legend, whereby, only the parts of the legend where 
corresponding bar charts appear (in colour or in grey) are actually shown in full opacity.
The others appear as 30% opacity.
