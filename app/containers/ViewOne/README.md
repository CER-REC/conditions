## CSS Grid Notes

When `display:grid` is applied to a element, the element becomes block level and participates in the flow.
Its immediate children are gird items, and follow the layout set by the parent grid.
A grid is defined by the as having a grid container which defines the bounds, inside it is composed of Grid Lines and Grid Track. A grid Track is the inner portion of a row or column. A grid line is just the line that separates tracks.

To follow the iLabs grid layout we have implemented a layout that has 12 columns per row
