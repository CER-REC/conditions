## CSS Grid Notes

When `display:grid` is applied to a element, the element becomes block level and participates in the 
flow. Its immediate children are gird items, and follow the layout set by the parent grid.
A grid is defined by having a grid container which defines the bounds. Inside of the grid is 
'grid lines' and 'grid tracks'. A grid track is the inner portion of a row or column. 
A grid line is just the line that separates tracks.
