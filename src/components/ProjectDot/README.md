# ProjectDot

TODO: determine size of dot (perhaps based on the size of the parent?)

The ProjectDot component is part of the company wheel and meant to make part of the company flag representing a project. Please note project dots are not displayed in the location wheel. 

The ProjectDot component has three different states represented by different colours: 
* default: meaning it is not filtered or relevant.
* filtered: the dot has been hit with a search parameter.
* relevant: the dot is related to the currently selected company in the list.

## Interaction Requirements

There are no interactions with the dots other than the parameters passed from the parent. 

## Accessibility Requirements

None.

## Analytics Requirements

All Analytic requirements are handled by the main parent component (CompanyWheel)

## Unit Testing

TODO: Provide table of automated unit test results and code coverage metrics.
