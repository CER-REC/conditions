    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p className="first">
      This Incidents at NEB-Regulated Pipeline and Facilities interactive online
      tool is part of the National Energy Board&apos;s (NEB) Data Visualization
      Initiative (DVI). The DVI is a three-year initiative to transform how the
      NEB structures and shares data. The objective is to enable evidence-based
      decision making and remove barriers to understanding Canada&apos;s energy
      and pipeline systems through the use of user-friendly interactive visualizations.
      This visualization is based on NEB data from 2008 to present for incidents
      reported under the Onshore Pipeline Regulations and the Processing Plant Regulation.
      In the months and years to come we will use this innovative format to share
      our pipeline safety data, energy data series, energy infrastructure information,
      and a host of other topical data. In addition, other online tools can be found
      in the NEB Safety Performance Portal.

      If you want to use the data for research and undertake your own review, all
      data is downloadable and shareable. The chart images are also downloadable.

      We hope we are hitting the mark. Your feedback is essential.
