The DVI is a three-year initiative to transform how the NEB structures and shares data. The objective is to enable evidence-based decision making and remove barriers to understanding Canada's energy and pipeline systems through the use of user-friendly interactive visualizations. This visualization is based on NEB data from 2008 to present for incidents reported under the Onshore Pipeline Regulations and the Processing Plant Regulation. In the months and years to come we will use this innovative format to share our pipeline safety data, energy data series, energy infrastructure information, and a host of other topical data. In addition, other online tools can be found in the NEB Safety Performance Portal.\nIf you want to use the data for research and undertake your own review, all data is downloadable and shareable. The chart images are also downloadable.\nWe hope we are hitting the mark. Your feedback is essential.\nEmail us with your comments and ideas: energyindesign@neb-one.gc.ca.
